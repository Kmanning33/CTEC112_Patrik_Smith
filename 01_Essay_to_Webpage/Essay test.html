<p>In this research paper the topic of the second KKK will be discussed. Commonly thought of as not a distinct entity
    from the original KKK, new light will be shed on the true nonexistent difference between the KKKs. Further, the
    second KKKs motives for pursuing domination of the political system, and their partial completion of that goal; the
    total corruption of certain local governments with certain emphasis on Portland's history of hate, and their
    acceptance of the KKK into their daily lives. Also, the proprietary players of the KKK, specifically the founders of
    the movement, such as, Simmons, Taylor and Clarke. Also Brought into view is a look at the dissolution of the
    organized KKK, and the KKKs Remnants.
<p/>

<p>The KKK specifically developed their group to be in line with religious values given by Christianity, these values
    also happened to be in line with the values of the average day American, thus contributing to the fast growth of the
    KKK. The invisible structure of the KKK (created by the rational American) was able to make itself at large in a
    sort amount of time, growing in influence and support, along with members and politicians; The KKK, with these
    underpinnings was able to establish a launching off point for the gradual corruption of governments, and the winning
    over of the people’s minds. One of the major platforms for the KKK was the Pacific Northwest, perhaps looking to
    feed off of the younger regions unestablished identity, the KKK took roots to this region.
<p/>

<p>In 1915, perhaps one of the most influential events on the perception and rationalization of the second KKK happened,
    the movie Birth of a Nation was released. This movie was abhorrent in its portrayal of the black man whilst at the
    same time promoting the Morales of the KKK, seemingly even more distasteful was the incumbent president’s (Woodrow,
    Wilson) praise for the movie, he enjoyed it so much that he even played it in the white house, he said about the
    movie “It is like writing history with lightening. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.” The type
    of attitude exhibited by major players in the 20s most definitely played a role in convincing the American people
    that the KKK was something to be enjoyed if not outright endorsed. Henry Ford decided to endorse the KKK when in
    1920 he published a book called The Protocols of The Elders of Zion, in his book he ultimately purveyed and
    rationalized the existence of the KKK with his litany of anti-Semitic material. However, Ford was not done yet, a
    few years later he chronologically went through a 91 series article containing more anti-Semitic ravings.
<p/>

<p>There were groups of the KKK who decided to propagate their messages of racism by returning to the ‘old ways’.
    However the more violent groups were fazed out of existence due to lack of public support. A notable KKK sect that
    was led by William Joseph Simmons , that had connections with Elizabeth Tyler and Edward young Clarke, forged an
    alliance between them that proved monumental in the expansion of the second KKK. Clarke and Tyler were seasoned
    business owners, so they were able to transform the KKK into a money machine, also being adept at propaganda they
    exponentially increased the amount of ears that could hear the good word of the KKK. Simmons especially benefited
    from his new compatriots business savvy, he had an average salary of 33,000 a year and got a 25,000 dollar bonus
    roughly equivalent to 300,000 dollars in today’s money.
<p/>

<p>Unfortunately for Simmons he had fallen into a trap of power, violating his own rules against depravity, he began
    gambling on horse races and drinking frequently, despite his position on prohibition. In response to this Tyler,
    Clarke, and a few other Klan leaders decided to out Simmons. In order to boot Simmons Taylor and Clarke had to buy
    him out, because legally the club was his property. Simmons having been “usurped” started a many numerous Klans that
    continually failed, thus leading to the rest of his unremarkable life and death in 1945 (Some say that the KKK in in
    1921 had at least 850,00 members, more likely the number was fewer however the fact that number was used proves the
    peoples belief in the KKK.)
<p/>

<p>Soon after Simmons was ‘let go’ the Klan found a new imperial wizard in Hiram Evans. Soon after Evans was hired, he
    cleaned house of Clarke and Tyler. Evans had ambitious plans and he need not keep them on payroll when they had
    already played their part. Evans big plans for the KKK was to make it a political party. He began shifting the
    values and morals of the Klan to match his own personality, first by setting stricter rules for drinking, then by
    moving headquarters to Washington DC, and focusing on promoting the Klans Americanism. He included revisions for
    recruiting, forcing the recruiters to make nonviolent oaths, making newspapers, and hiring professional
    speechwriters. In essence he was attempting to legitimize the KKK so as to gain even more national recognition, and
    in doing so make the KKK seem as if it was comprised of rational citizens, thus normalizing the KKK.
<p/>

<p>The general public enamored by Evans superb speeches and Taylors crafty propaganda, had decided to accept the KKK as
    part of their daily life. The public normalized the KKK so much that they did not care if the KKK put its meetings
    on the front page of newspapers or actively recruited at high schools. By the 1920s the KKK had become a national
    force, occupying political power and winning the people’s hearts. Part of this success is given to the ability of
    the Klan’s leaders to un-radicalize themselves, they were able to create a façade of being just “regular Americans.
    In the beginning this façade worked but as the years went on people began to see past the KKKs front, and into the
    true meaning behind the movement.
<p/>

<p>The KKK continued to gain popularity, promoting with rallies whereas thousands of people would attend, these parades
    were also not exclusive given that you were white and naturalized, they were open to the public. These unprotested
    parades of the KKK showcase the power that the group wielded at the time. Further normalizing the Klan were the
    baseball teams, because if you pay baseball you are grandfathered into being an American. Working against the clans
    attempts to not seem radical and violent were the ever more frequent attacks on citizens and rival clans. In Oregon
    people were warned that certain Klan members were carrying rifles at night, The KKK also started burning crosses
    some even a hundred feet high. In one case Klansmen strung up a black man, proceeded to let him down three times
    each time firing shots at his feet, to make him dance. The juries acquitted the culprits of all charges, on the
    grounds that because the victim was morally bad that the punishment was just. Also working against the Morales
    upheld by the KKK was the persecution of anyone against their goal. In one case a mayor in Kansas was kidnapped and
    whipped 38 times. Local police also handed over suspects involved in crimes over to the KKK for “light” torture,
    sometimes the officers even took part in said torture.</p>

<p>The people were not the only ones being corrupted by the KKK’s agenda, the government was also greatly affected by
    the KKK. Many towns had mayors that were in fact in open support of the KKK, openly endorsing and sometimes even
    members themselves. Another instance of corruption is when the governor of Oklahoma, had placed certain parts of his
    state under martial law because of the massive amount of Klan related violence, however he found himself impeached
    soon after. </p>

<p>The second KKK started as a group of racist people looking to make a quick buck. The first Klans led by William
    Joseph Simmons rebuilt the ideals from the original KKK, with a more moderate approach. Simmons entered into a
    partnership with two entrepreneurs named Taylor and Clarke; Taylor and Clarke revolutionized the Propaganda of the
    KKK turning the Klan into a machine, their product being the word of the KKK and money. However, Taylor and Clarke’s
    partner Simmons was began to act out of turn, he started to drink and spend money profusely on gambling. Because of
    this he had to be fired, in his place Clarke and Taylor brought in Hiram Evans the new grand wizard, ironically he
    fired them directly after being hired. Evans decided to institute another ‘revitalization’ of the codes and conduct
    of the KKK, unfortunately for him the public was losing interest in the KKK, and so were his subordinates.
    Eventually The Klans descended into chaos, fighting each other and bringing upon themselves the end of their
    time.</p>
